  <p>I'm a critical-thinking, fast learning young professional with a profound knowledge
    of the entertainment industry.
    I attended the Johns Hopkins Unversity, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in History and Spanish
    with both University and Departmental honors in 2013.
I have experience and expertise across multiple fields, from event marketing to digital cinema distribution.
